## Overview
SpamHam Classifier is a simple Machine Learning (ML) model designed to classify messages as either "Spam" or "Ham" (not spam). The model is deployed on the Railway cloud platform using Git for version control. It leverages Scikit-Learn for training and prediction, Streamlit for a user-friendly web interface, and Joblib for model serialization.

## Project Structure
The project consists of the following files:

ðŸ“‚ SpamHam Classifier
â”œâ”€â”€ app.py - The main script for running the Streamlit web app.

â”œâ”€â”€ spam-ham - Pre-trained model file stored in Joblib format.

â”œâ”€â”€ Procfile - Specifies the command to run the app on Railway.

â”œâ”€â”€ setup.sh - Shell script for setting up dependencies.

â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt - Lists all the required Python libraries.

## Installation
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Spam-ham-Classifier-Railways.git

cd Spam-ham-Classifier-Railways

## Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Run the application locally:
streamlit run app.py

## Deployment on Railway
Create a Railway account:

  Go to Railway and sign up.

Deploy the project:

  Create a new project and link your GitHub repository.Add environment variables if needed.Railway will automatically detect the Procfile and deploy the app.

## Usage
Open the deployed web app.Enter a message into the input field.

Click the "Predict" button to classify the message as Spam or Ham.

## Dependencies

The following libraries are required to run the project:

Streamlit - For building the web interface

Scikit-Learn - For ML model training and prediction

Joblib - For model serialization

Install them using:

pip install streamlit scikit-learn joblib
